        body: `Web3Edu treats learning as a first-class Web3 concept — not as content to consume, but as identity to build.

Learners develop real blockchain skills through hands-on labs, experiments, and direct interaction with decentralized systems. Each step of progress becomes verifiable, composable, and reusable across the ecosystem.

With on-chain credentials and participation in the Web3Edu DAO, learning does not end at completion. It evolves through contribution, collaboration, and shared governance — shaping both the learner and the platform itself.`,
